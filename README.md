This is a collection of some coding tests that I got lazy to send out that I finished. Hopefully, it helps to assist people who are doing coding tests in Python. 

# Coding Tests:

* [CSV Test]: The bio field contains text with arbitrary padding, spacing and line breaks. Normalize these values to a space-delimited string.

* [CSV Test 2]: There is a supplementary CSV file for download here: state_abbreviations.csv. This "data dictionary" contains state abbreviations alongside state names. For the state field of the input CSV, replace each state abbreviation with its associated state name from the data dictionary.
